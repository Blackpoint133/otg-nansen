# Operations

The reference OTG deployment uses Windows services wrapped by NSSM, with
separate importer, indexer, overview, and Streamlit roles. Logs are kept in
the existing OTG logging layout and scheduled tasks are used for selected
staging and refresh jobs. No Nansen service or scheduled task exists.

Future Nansen work should remain a foreground, bounded, read-only validated
process until its persistence and retry behavior are reviewed. No operational
component was added in Phase 0B.
